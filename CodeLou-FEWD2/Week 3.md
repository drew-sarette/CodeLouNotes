# Functions
A function is a block of organized, reusable code that serves a single purpose.

A function is *declared* using the function keyword, (), and the statements to be executed are put into {}

```
function newFunc (params) {
    //statements
}

const otherFunc = function (params) {
    //statements
}
```
The *parameters* are variables passed into a function. They are called *arguments* when the function is called and they are being passed in.

The arguments object is an array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to the function.

```
console.log(arguments[2]);
//logs the value of the third argument passed into the function
```

## Scope
Variables declared with const or let have function scope. They are not accessible outside the function. However, functions can access variables in parent functions.

## Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
A function that is run as soon as it is defined. Entire function is enclosed in (), and then invoked with another set of () and a ; right after. They are anonymous.
```
(function () {
  // â€¦
})();
```
Typically used for initialization, because it avoids polluting the global namespace.  If the 

## Closures
Allow access to variables that were in function scope earlier from outside the function. Can be used with an IIFE
```
let greeting = (function() {
    let message = 'hello';
    let getMessage = function() {
        return message;
    };
    return {
        getMessage: getMessage,
    };
})();
console.log(greeting.getMessage()); // hello
```
according to MDN, a closure is the combination of a function bundled together with its lexical environment. Lexical environment refers to an inner function's access to its parent functions' variables.

In this example, the function displayName() is returned from makeFunc *before it is executed*. This is possible because JS creates a closure tying displayName to its lexical environment, so that it can access name at a later time.

```
function makeFunc() {
  const name = 'Mozilla';
  function displayName() {
    console.log(name);
  }
  return displayName;
}

const myFunc = makeFunc();
myFunc();
```
The benefit of using the IIFE version is that it cuts out the extra function that had to be made in the second example.

A common use of closures is an event in a web browser. 
```
function makeSizer(size) {
  return function () {
    document.body.style.fontSize = `${size}px`;
  };
}

const size12 = makeSizer(12);
const size14 = makeSizer(14);
const size16 = makeSizer(16);
```
is an easy way to create three different custom functions.

Q: What is a callback?
Q: What is the benefit of returning an object containing a function vs just a function?

## Arrow Functions
Simpler way to write a function expression. Not a perfect substitute for a standard function. Different treatment of 'this' keyword. In a standard function, this refers to the function object.  In an arrow function, this refers to the window object. Dont use this in arrow functions!

```
let greeting = function() {
    return 'hello';
}

let greeting = () => {
    return 'hello';
}

// for no params, it looks like this:
let greeting = () => 'hello';

//for one param, it looks like this
let greeting = name => 'hello ' + name;
