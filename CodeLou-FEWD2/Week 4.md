# Modules
Before modules, you could separate js into different files and load them individually via script tags, to organize the code better. However, that pollutes the namespace for all js since everything in any file is accessible in any other file. IIFE's can be used to shield the contents of a file from being accessed from another.

Modules solve that problem by doing the same thing with just import and export keywords.

## Exports
- named
- default
- aggregate


## Imports
